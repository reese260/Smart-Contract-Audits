CodeHawks First Flights is a Cyfrin flagship initiative to introduce the next generation of web3 developers to smart contract security audits.

It goes beyond the traditional learning process by offering a format for emerging auditors to gain hands-on experience with real-world web3 security audits and receive feedback and advice on their submitted findings.
